Hello, I'm <strong>Abin Zacharia</strong>, an architect turned software developer, passionate about pushing the boundaries of design and technology. With a solid foundation in architectural marvels and a growing expertise in software development, I thrive on finding innovative solutions that bridge the gap between these two worlds.

<strong> From Architectural Marvels to Digital Frontiers </strong>

With my few years of experience as an architect, I had the privilege of contributing to iconic projects such as the Gateway of India, Red Fort, and Galeries Lafayette, where I honed my skills in design development, project management, and preserving architectural heritage. These experiences instilled in me a deep appreciation for precision, attention to detail, and the power of creating spaces that inspire."

Driven by my fascination with technology and a desire to explore new frontiers, I made a transition into the world of software development. I have embarked on a journey to combine my architectural expertise with programming skills to create innovative digital solutions.
